## Cultural Diversity

The project was done to play around with Bokeh, a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation and different sharing options - Ananconda Cloud (https://anaconda.org/eponkratova/map/notebook) and GitHub Pages (https://eponkratova.github.io/cultural_diversity/).
